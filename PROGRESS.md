# Progress of Agent-ARRP
checkout [Phase-0/MVP](https://github.com/anemvamsi4/Agent-ARRP/tree/phase-0/MVP) branch, for progress!
## Currently Working

- [ ] Phase-0: Create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the agent to reproduce a research paper.

    - [x] Basic data extraction (text, equations, tables, figures) from the paper
    - [ ] Genetaring Implementation plan for code generation
    - [ ] Basic code generation (Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow) for the extracted implementation details
    - [ ] Basic code execution and result comparison (if possible)
    - [ ] Basic report generation for execution of the generated code
    - [ ] Basic user interface for the agent to interact with the user (maybe)


## TO DO
- [ ] Phase-1: Data Extraction and Parsing
- [ ] Phase-2: Code Generation & execution guide
- [ ] Phase-3: Code Execution and Result Comparison
- [ ] Phase-4: Report Generation
- [ ] Phase-5: User Interface and Integration

## Completed
- [ ] None yet
